üçø pppp: a tiny bash utility to manage project directories üçø
--------------------------------------

Do you frequently type ``cd``?  Do you often switch between different
projects several times a day?  Then pppp is for you.

pppp is a tiny utility for Bash that does one thing well - it keeps a stack of
working directories across Bash shells and terminal sessions.

Like many programmers, I have many projects and subprojects working at once, and
I often get interrupted with bug reports, requests or sudden inspiration, and
even get interrupted during interruptions, so I'm constantly moving between
multiple terminal windows and forgetting where I was.

You can learn pppp in two minutes and it has copious documentation.

pppp saves me minutes a day, reminds of where I was when I get interrupted, and
never gets in my way.

Installation
---------------

Download the file
`pppp.sh <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rec/pppp/master/pppp.sh>`_
and save it somewhere convenient.

Then in your .bashrc, add a line ``source /path/to/your/pppp.sh`` to define the
Bash function ``pppp``. Many users add ``alias p=pppp``, and the documentation
below assumes that.


``pppp`` Commands
-------------------

Commands can be abbreviated down to a single character, so ``p rotate``,
``p rot`` and ``p r`` all mean the same thing.

"cd" is short for "change the current working directory in the shell".

Push
==========
* ``p <directory>``
* ``p push <directory>``

  Push ``<directory>`` onto the stack and cd to it


Change directory
==================

The change directory commands don't change the stack, only the current
directory.

* ``p``
* ``p 0``
* ``p cd 0``

  cd to the top of the stack, or print the stack if you are already there.

* ``p 1``
* ``p 2``
* ``p <n>``

  cd to the first, second or nth below the top of the stack

* ``p -1``
* ``p -2``
* ``p -<n>``

  cd to directories at the bottom of the stack


Pop
==========

* ``p pop``
* ``p pop 0``
* ``p p``

  Pop the top directory off the stack and cd to the new top

* ``p pop <n>``

  Pop the <n>th directory.  If n is 0, cd to the new top


Reordering the stack: swap and rotate
=======================

These commands change the stack, and then cd to its top

* ``p swap``
* ``p s``

  Swap the top two directories in the stack

------

* ``p rotate 1``
* ``p rotate``
* ``p rot``
* ``p r``

  Rotate the whole stack forward so the top moves to the bottom

* ``p rot 2``

  Rotate the stack two steps forward

* ``p rot -1``
* ``p rot -``

  Rotate the stack one step backward so the bottom moves to the top

* ``p rot -3``

  Rotate the stack two steps backward

* ``p rot 0``

  Does nothing


Housekeeping: list, clear, undo
==================================

* ``p list``

  List the stack

* ``p clear``

  Clear the stack

* ``p undo``

  Undo the previous change to the stack and cds to the top of it

Tips:
-----------

If you want to jump back to the directory you were in before you typed ``p``,
use ``cd -``.

By default, pppp prints what it has done, and prints the whole stack every
time it changes.  You can disable that by either passing in the
``-q``/``--quiet`` flag, or setting the ``PPPP_QUIET`` environment variable.


My ``p`` workflow
-------------------------------

* I alias ``pppp`` to ``p`` to avoid typing.

* When I switch to a terminal window or open a new one, I type ``p`` to cd to my
  top project.

* When I get a new project I use ``p <dirname>`` to start work on it as my new
  top project, pushing the previous one down a level.

* Later I use ``p p`` (pop) to cd back to the previous project, if the new
  project is finished.

* Or if it is not, I use ``p r`` (rotate) to rotate the new project to the
  bottom and cd back to the previous project.

* When I'm cleaning up clutter. I use ``p p -1`` (pop) to pop my oldest task

* When I'm working with two directories I push them both and then use ``p s``
  (swap) to move back and forth.

* And I use ``p u`` (undo) when I make a mistake.


FAQ:
-----------

Q: Why ``pppp``?

A: It's a Project to Push and Pop other Projects.  Also, I use ``p`` as a
shortcut but ``p``, ``pp``, and ``ppp`` are too short or already taken.

Q: What new features are expected?

A: None.  Enough is as good as a feast.  (But I am very open to feature requests
that do not expand the scope of the project excessively.)

Q: Where does ``pppp`` store the the persistent stack?

A: In a file named ``.pppp.json``, which by default is in the config directory
``$HOME/.config/``.  To change this config directory, set the environment
variable ``XDG_CONFIG_HOME``.

Q: What's this XDG thing?

A: `This specification
<https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html>`_
for where your config files should go .

See also `this article <https://0x46.net/thoughts/2019/02/01/dotfile-madness/>`.

Q: Why is there Python code embedded in a Bash script?  Why the Makefile and the
build step?  Why not just distribute a Python script?

A: Pure Python cannot change the directory in your shell - some Bash is needed.
But doing the whole thing in Bash was too hard.

I could have distributed it as a Python file and a small Bash file but I felt a
single file was better for everyone, even though it's a little more complicated
behind the scenes.

See also `this discussion
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2375003/how-do-i-set-the-working-directory-of-the-parent-process>`_
which seems to show that no better way is possible.
